# Cartography

This branch contains a GitHub action which automatically syncs the
[`upstream`](https://github.com/praetorian-inc/cartography/tree/upstream) branch with
the `master` branch in [`lyft/cartography`](https://github.com/lyft/cartography).

## Contributions

Create a feature branch off the `upstream` branch and PR directly to `lyft/cartography`.

```
git checkout upstream
git switch -c some-feature
```
